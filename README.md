### Setup

- Plant level
  - Connected to PORT 2 on edge device.

- OT Level edge device
  - Uses Port 1 for PC connection
  - Uses Port 2 for PLC connection
  - Applications
    - Dataservice - Saves data from southbound device in database    
    - IE Databus - Is used as data channel - MQTT broker      
    - SIMATIC S7 Connector - used for data retrieve from plc
    - Energy manager - Dashboarding of energy data  
      
- OT Level PLC
  - [Uses Tia Tank sample application](https://github.com/industrial-edge/miscellaneous#tank-application)

# Get started

## Networks
  - PLANT-USER network 192.168.1.x/24 range
  - PLANT-OT network 192.168.0.x/24 range  
  - Devices:
    - PLC: 
      - 192.168.0.10
    - Edge Device: 
      - port 1: 192.168.1.10
      - port 2: 192.168.0.11
    - MYPC :
      - port: 192.168.1.11     

## OT - Level
  Run Tia tank project on PLC SIM Advanced, or use a real PLC - Use a 1500 plc [Link Tia Portal Project](https://github.com/industrial-edge/miscellaneous#tank-application)  Or use your own project.  
  Give this PLC ip adress in range of the OT-South network, for example 192.168.0.10

## PLANT - Level
Install the required apps on edge device
- Simatic s7 Connector 
- IE Databus 
- Energy Manager
- Data Service
 
Setup the network settings  on edge device
  - Give the Edge-Device Port 2 ip adress in range of the OT-South network, for example 192.168.0.11
  - Give the Edge-Device Port 1 ip adress in range of the South-North network, for example 192.168.1.10

### Southbound - Simatic s7 Connector
1. Open the Industrial Edge Management - Go to Data Connections - Select the Simatic S7 connector

2. Launch on the Southbound device - select S7 or OPCUA (we use opcua) - add data Source 
![s7connector2](files/edgedevice-s7-connector-2-add-opcua.JPG)
3. Fill in the ip adress and port 192.168.0.10 port 4840 and save
4. Set the settings - use username: edge and password: edge, then press save.

6. Deploy and start project, wait until done.

### Southbound - IE Databus
1. Open the Industrial Edge Management - Go to Data Connections - Select the IE Databus
2. Launch on the Southbound device 
3. Add user + 
![iedatabus1](files/edgedevice-ie-databus-1.JPG)
4. Topic: ie/#, username: edge, password: edge, permission: publish and subscribe, click on add.
5. Deploy, wait until its done

### Southbound - Flow Creator
1. open flow creator - on edge device, login with edge credentials 
2. add mqtt in node
3. add server: 
    - server: ie-databus
    - port: 1883
    - security - user: edge
    - security - password: edge
    - click on save
    - ![flowcreator1](files/edgedevice-flow-creator-1.JPG)
4. set topic:
    - ie/#
    - click on done.
5. add message node and connect, then deploy.
6. check if data is flowing in debug window.

### Edgedevice - Dataservice 
1. Open Dataservice - on edge device.
2. Go to adapter and add adapter
![Dataservice](files/edgedevice-dataservice-1.JPG)
3. Fill in fields:
   - name: southbound_Device
   - url: tcp://ie-databus:1883
   - name: edge
   - password: edge
   - metadata: ie/d/j/simatic/v1/ied1:s7c1/dp/
   ![Dataservice2](files/edgedevice-dataservice-2.JPG)
4. Click save
5. and enable the new adapter, check if it is connected.
